## üåü Why YouLy+?

YouTube Music & Tidal are great for listening, but their default lyrics are often just static, plain text.  
YouLy+ completely transforms this by injecting a rich, interactive, and beautifully animated karaoke-style experience directly into the player interface.

It's lightweight, fully open-source, and designed to make your music sessions more engaging and fun.

## ‚ú® Features

YouLy+ is packed with features designed to enhance your lyrics experience:

### üé§ Core Lyrics Experience

-   **Advanced Synchronized Lyrics:** Enjoy real-time, accurately synced lyrics with line-by-line highlighting.
-   **Word-by-Word Highlighting:** Immersive karaoke-style experience with precise word highlighting.
-   **Official Subtitle Fallback:** Automatically uses official subtitles if synced lyrics aren't available.
-   **Multiple Providers:** Choose where your lyrics come from! Works seamlessly for both YouTube Music and Tidal.
-   **Native Integration:** Replaces default lyrics panel with custom, interactive elements. Click-to-seek, scroll to find lines, and more!

### üåê Translation & Romanization

-   **Instant Translation:** Translate lyrics on the fly using **Google Translate** or the powerful **Gemini AI** (need API KEY).
-   **Romanization:** See lyrics written in the familiar English alphabet, even for languages that use different writing systems (like Japanese, Korean, or Russian). (Only for some songs, if it doesn't exist, it will use lyrics-on-the-fly romanization)
-   **Full Gemini AI Control:** For advanced users, you can connect your own Gemini AI account, choose different AI settings, and even create your own instructions for how translations should work.

### üé® Appearance & Customization

-   **Dynamic Theming:** Lyrics and backgrounds automatically adapt to the **song's color palette**.
-   **Visual Effects:** Enable an Apple Music-style **blur for inactive lines** to improve focus.
-   **Custom Look:** If you know a bit about web design, you can use custom code (CSS) to make the lyrics look exactly how you want them.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance & Integration

-   **Fast & Smooth:** YouLy+ is designed to run quickly and smoothly, even on older computers, without slowing down your system.
-   **Performance Modes:** Utilize **Lightweight Mode** or **Compatibility Mode** for smooth animations on any machine.
-   **SponsorBlock Integration:** Automatically skip non-music segments like intros, outros, and sponsor messages.
-   **Smart Saving:** YouLy+ remembers lyrics it has already found, so they load faster next time and use less internet data.
